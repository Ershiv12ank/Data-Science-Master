    "### The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class. It allows the class to control access to its internal data and ensures that the data is accessed and modified only through defined methods. Encapsulation helps achieve data hiding, abstraction, and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class, also known as a base class or superclass. The derived class, also called a child class or subclass, inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class. Inheritance promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the creation of hierarchical relationships among classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means having many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables a single interface or method to be used to represent different types of objects. It allows flexibility and abstraction, making code more generic and adaptable to different data types or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the process of simplifying complex systems by representing essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It allows the creation of abstract classes or interfaces that define common behavior without specifying implementation details. Abstraction focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it. It helps manage complexity, improves code maintainability, and supports modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars are fundamental concepts in OOP and provide the foundation for building modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems. They contribute to the key principles of OOP, such as code reusability, extensibility, and separation of concerns."
